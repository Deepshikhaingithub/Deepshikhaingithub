Throughout my academic journey, I have worked on various projects that have sharpened my data science skills. Some of the noteworthy projects include:</h4>
  
<h4>
Time Series Analysis: 
Developed a time series Analysis model on HCLTech stock price dataset that helped in identifying trends, patterns, and potential future movements.</h4>

<h4>
Olympics Data Analysis:
Conducted a comprehensive analysis of Olympic data spanning multiple editions of the Games, explore patterns in athlete performance, identify factors contributing to medal-winning performances, country-wise analysis etc.</h4>

<h4>
Real Estate Price Prediction : 
Developed a predictive model for Bengaluru house prices using linear regression, ridge regression, lasso regression, and XGBoost algorithms with an objective to accurately predict house prices based on various features and assess the performance of each model.</h4>

<h4>
AirCargo Analysis using SQL : 
This project involved an analysis of an air cargo company's database, focusing on various aspects such as entity-relationship modeling, database querying, stored procedure creation, and data extraction for identifying the regular customers to provide offers, analyze the busiest route which helps to increase the number of aircraft required and prepare an analysis to determine the ticket sales details which will help the company to improve its operability and to become more customer-centric and a favorable choice for air travel.</h4>

<h4>
These projects have allowed me to apply my knowledge in data preprocessing, feature engineering, model selection, and evaluation, demonstrating my ability to derive actionable insights and create valuable solutions using data-driven approaches. </h4>
